## walking

**At the time. When I walked around,   
I felt like everything is still.   
I must watch my head or my feet lest I fall.**

**But I noticed that as I went along,   
I passed some chirping bugs,   
NPCS in the game, less of a presence,   
but a testament to the reality and diversity of the world.**

**I felt the wind,   
which made my holey clothes feel cold and my cheeks feel caressed.**  

## standing
  
**When I was still,   
I noticed the noise,   
but beneath the loud human noise,   
there were some insects chirping,   
as if they were cicadas.**

**And some birds chirp.   
They can't beat the loud human noise further away.   
But one after another, it doesn't stop.   
I noticed some little bugs flying around me,   
coming in and out of sight from time to time.**

## sitting

**When I crouch down, I pay more attention to the roots of trees,    
the dead leaves that fall, the weeds, the messy clothes,   
the light is relatively low, and the details are many.**

**The smell became very present, almost all-consuming.   
When I crouch down I don't want to move anymore,   
because the moment is good.   
I noticed that everything was in its place,   
and the ants were moving between the dead leaves,   
but they were small and fast,   
and it was difficult for a magnifying glass or camera to catch them.**

## lying

**When I lay down, I felt extremely bright,   
and my eyes couldn't adapt to the intensity of the light.   
I had to close my eyes almost all the time.**

**The smell is still very much present.   
I felt the temperature on the ground very cold, almost biting,   
making it difficult for me to endure the feeling.   
After lying down for a few minutes, I had acclimated and felt drowsy.   
There seemed to be little bugs getting between my clothes and gnawing at my body,   
which made me think of some literature, huge people in tiny worlds,   
and that's how I feel right now.**
